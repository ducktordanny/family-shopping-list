# Family Shopping List

> Register/login to your account and create a new group/family add members and handle your shopping-list. Every member can see what has to be bought next time and they can edit if it's already bought etc.

## For later:

-   Deploy app to own iphone: https://medium.com/@tewolfe2/deploying-a-react-native-application-to-your-iphone-1d5f9757be48
-   React-Native with Redux: https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/react-native-redux/
-   Passport-verify: http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-verify/
-   Passport-jwt: https://www.sitepoint.com/spa-social-login-google-facebook/

## Should do later:

-   [ ] React Native store user accessToken on client: https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/usage
-   [ ] In authentication when we verify if a user is existing then we should just simply use User.findOrCreate(...).
-   [ ] Create a middleware for accessing to groups and items only if a user is included in that group.
-   [x] Redux.
-   [x] React Navigation for Stacks.
-   [x] Research for views.
-   [x] Validation for new group etc.
